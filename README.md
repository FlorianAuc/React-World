- Type of challenge: **learning**
- Repository : **`React-World`**
- Site : <a href="https://react-world-prod.netlify.app/" target="_blank"> React world app </a>

### Back config :

I made the database with a json file for the blog tab where the person can put a comment of 140 lines minimum, he can also delete or correct his comment. (The system does not work on the site, because the db is a js file ("localhost:3004"). To be able to use this tab you have to take the file and do the following command on your text editor

- 1 : `npm i` to take over the node_modules

- 2 : `npm start` To start the localhost

- 3 : `npm run server` to launch the .json file (db.json) which is a script I added to the package.json

### Front config :

For the front I used react and sass

- 1 : `npm i sass` to install sass
